Project: CineSou - Movie Catalog Web Application  
Date: August 2025  

Description:
------------
CineSou is a responsive, accessible movie catalog website designed to showcase various films in a clean and interactive layout. It features a home page, movie catalog, and contact form. The site follows HTML5 best practices, W3C standards, and WCAG accessibility guidelines.

All movie data is stored in an external XML file (`movies.xml`) and is dynamically loaded using JavaScript. The site also supports a light/dark mode switch with system preference detection and keyboard accessibility.
